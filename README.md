# Pizza Sales Dashboard 

## 1. Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze pizza sales performance, customer ordering patterns, and product trends across time, categories, and sizes.

## 2. Purpose
The Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales revenue, order trends, product performance, and customer preferences. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify top and low-performing pizzas, peak ordering times, and category-level insights to support business decisions.

## 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

 • Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for interactive data visualization
 • Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing
 • DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create KPIs and calculated measures
 • Data Modeling – Relationships established between orders, pizza details, categories, and sizes
 • SQL – Used to validate KPIs and cross-check aggregated results for data accuracy
 • File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews

## 4. Data Source

Source: Public Pizza Sales Dataset
The dataset contains detailed transactional data related to pizza sales, including:
Order dates and times
Pizza names, categories, and sizes
Quantity sold and revenue generated
Order-level details for trend and performance analysis
The data spans a full calendar year, enabling seasonal and time-based analysis.

## 5. Features / Highlights
### Business Problem
Pizza chains generate large volumes of sales data daily, but raw transactional data makes it difficult to answer key business questions such as:
Which pizzas generate the highest revenue?
What are the busiest days and months?
Which categories and sizes drive the most sales?
Which products should be promoted or discontinued?

### Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive and intuitive analytics tool that:
Tracks overall sales performance and key KPIs
Identifies best- and worst-performing pizzas
Highlights peak ordering times and seasonal trends
Supports data-driven decisions for pricing, promotions, and inventory planning

### Key Visuals
KPIs: Total Revenue, Avg Order Value, Total Orders, Total Pizzas Sold
Trends: Daily and monthly order volume
Product Analysis: Best & worst pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders
Category & Size Analysis: Sales distribution and volume comparison

### Business Impact
Improve promotion and pricing strategies
Optimize inventory and staffing for peak periods
Identify underperforming menu items
Understand customer buying behavior
